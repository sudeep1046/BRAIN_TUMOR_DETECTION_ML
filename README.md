# BRAIN_TUMOR_DETECTION_ML

Brain Tumor Detection Using VGG16
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model used is VGG16, which has been fine-tuned for this specific binary classification task.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to assist in medical diagnostics by accurately classifying MRI images into categories indicating the presence or absence of a brain tumor.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:

Dataset Name: Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection
Link: Kaggle Dataset
Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Images are resized to a consistent shape, and labels are encoded for training.
Model Architecture: Utilizes the pre-trained VGG16 model with additional custom fully connected layers.
Training: The model is trained with a combination of categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
Validation: The model’s performance is validated using a separate test set.
Evaluation: Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to monitor the model’s performance.
Results
The model achieves significant accuracy in detecting brain tumors from MRI images. The training and validation metrics indicate strong performance.
